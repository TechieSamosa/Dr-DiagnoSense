#### **Welcome to Dr. DiagnoSense, Your Personal Health Assistant Powered by Machine Learning!**

#### **About**
Dr. DiagnoSense is a groundbreaking project that represents the pinnacle of innovation in healthcare technology. It is a derivative project inspired by Aditya Khamitkar's original creation, DoctorBot, developed in collaboration with Intel and the Government of India. While DoctorBot focused on directly providing health insights, Dr. DiagnoSense inherits the spirit of leveraging machine learning techniques to provide health insights.

#### **Objective**
The aim of Dr. DiagnoSense is to offer a language-based health assistant that analyzes symptoms, provides probable causes of conditions, and suggests medications, all free of cost. It leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to detect and provide insights on various health conditions including Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors, breast cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, and heart attacks. The ultimate goal is to create a Language Learning Model (LLM) that users can interact with to discuss their health concerns.

#### **Disease Prediction**
Dr. DiagnoSense utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms tailored to each health condition for accurate disease prediction:
- **Alzheimer's Disease:** Utilizes cognitive assessment data and neuroimaging techniques to detect early signs of Alzheimer's.
- **Brain Tumor:** Analyzes MRI images to detect brain tumors.
- **Breast Cancer:** Utilizes mammogram images to detect signs of breast cancer.
- **Heart Attack Detection:** Analyzes various health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate to assess the risk of heart attacks.

#### **How to Use**
1. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. See the `requirements.txt` file for details.
2. **Run Dr. DiagnoSense:** Execute the main script to start interacting with Dr. DiagnoSense.
3. **Discuss Your Health:** Type in your symptoms or health concerns to start a conversation with Dr. DiagnoSense.
4. **Receive Insights:** Dr. DiagnoSense will analyze your inputs and provide insights on potential health conditions and medications.

#### **Project Structure**
Dr. DiagnoSense is structured to ensure efficient data collection, preprocessing, and disease prediction:
- The project includes separate modules for each health condition, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Brain Tumor, Breast Cancer, and Heart Attack Detection.
- Each module consists of machine learning algorithms tailored to the specific health condition, with the trained models saved as pickle files (`*.pkl`).
- The web application is built using Streamlit (`dr_diagnosense.py`) for easy interaction with users.
