# MRI Brain Tumor Diagnosis using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project is dedicated to the precise detection of brain tumors through advanced deep learning techniques. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model constructed with TensorFlow Keras, it aims to accurately diagnose brain tumors from MRI scans, categorizing them into four classes: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary.

## Problem Statement
Brain tumors pose a significant medical challenge, demanding timely detection and intervention. Manual scrutiny of MRI scans for tumor identification is labor-intensive and prone to errors. This project addresses the need for automating tumor detection using deep learning, enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis.

## Objective
The primary goal of this endeavor is to develop a robust CNN model capable of classifying brain MRI images into the aforementioned tumor classes, including scans indicative of a healthy brain. By automating this detection process, our aim is to furnish medical professionals with a dependable tool for expediting brain tumor diagnosis.

## Getting Started
